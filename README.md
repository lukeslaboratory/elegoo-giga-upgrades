Welcome!

Here lies all of the modifications on the Elegoo Orangestorm Giga that leveled it up to the Bluestorm Tera!

I've provided the models neccessary for your own modifications in case you have a better plan or want to build it yourself!

Otherwise - You can purchase all of these modifications at lukeslabonline for a simpler experience.
If neccessary - I can also offer service and install - [contact me using the contact page on my shop!](https://lukeslabonline.com/policies/contact-information)

A quick sumamary of the mods:
1) I replaced the controller board with a BTT Kraken + Pi4 - This is entirely unneccessary - with the advent of [OpenGiga 
](https://github.com/OpenNeptune3D/OpenOrangeStorm) You will be able to re-flash your existing controller with open, accessable firmware that you can then replace with dangerklipper and teach how to beacon in no time!
IF you don't feel like getting your own flasher, [we offer it as a convenient service.](https://lukeslabonline.com/products/elegoo-giga-emmc-flashing-service)
  1a) Otherwise, feel free to pick up a [BTT Kraken](https://amzn.to/3AQFFIv) and a [RPI4](https://amzn.to/4eiF292)
       But Honestly - Your need only 4 drivers on your board and Canbus - Any of these boards will work. You 100% need at least 2x 5160 drivers to power X and Y, and its recommended 2x more 5160 drivers for Z.
       - [Octopus V1.1](https://amzn.to/3Xk2NXt)
       - [SKR 3](https://amzn.to/3AZJ1Ju)
2) Run the complete toolhead [(purchasable here)](https://lukeslabonline.com/products/elegoo-giga-toolhead-conversion)
3) Update the bed to use solid standoffs instead of the myriad of springs- This is viable because of the beacon allowing for excellent compensation. (Purchase aluminum ones here)[https://lukeslabonline.com/products/elegoo-giga-standoffs-aluminum]
4) Add a camera to the upper corner - the (Luke's Lab camera)[https://lukeslabonline.com/products/usb-camera-1080p] has IR LEDS+Mechanical IR filter for exellent vision without having to keep the lights on!
5) Add a single-peice steel sheet to the bed - this is still TBD as it works perfectly, it requires adhesive for every print and is fun to ship. I can offer it for sale, but am currently working on a place stateside to coat them in PEI.

If you find cool mods that you'd like added, reach out and tell me! I'm looking to have everyone have the best possible experience with the Giga!
